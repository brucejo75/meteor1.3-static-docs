## Static copy of the Meteor 1.3 docs
I really like being able to use browser search to find API elements.  The redesign is still working on recapturing that feature.
In the meantime here is a simple snapshot of the 1.3 docs as of 5-25-2016 based on the older format.

Simply clone it and point your browser at it.

If you find any broken links, feel free to drop me an issue or a pull request.  I will happily fix.

Enjoy!
